## PLEASE ⭐STAR⭐ THE REPO IF YOU LIKE IT! THANKS!

### Notes
- SERVERNAME can only contain specific words:
  - https://github.com/landfallgames/tabg-word-list
- IT IS HIGHLY recommended to check the game_settings.txt in the serverfiles folder(click Browse)
- It is highly recommended to enable EmbeddConsole as the join code will be posted there
- Hosting will be tunneled through unity server by default and you should not need a public IP
  - if you don't want that or have high pings: 
  - Set Relay=false
- Ignore WindowsGSM Options for that server. they are not used besides setting the initial game_settings.txt
